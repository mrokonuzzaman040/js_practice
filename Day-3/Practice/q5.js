// Difference between while loop and for loop
//
// The while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use while loop.
// The for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.
// The while loop is entry controlled loop. In while loop, condition is evaluated first and then the statements inside loop body gets executed.
// The for loop is entry controlled loop. In for loop, initialization, condition checking and updation are done in the same line.
// The while loop is faster than for loop because for loop contains three statements.
// The for loop is slower than while loop because for loop contains three statements.
// The while loop is used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of loop beforehand.
// The for loop is used in situations where we already know the number of iterations of loop beforehand.
// The while loop is used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of loop beforehand.
// The for loop is used in situations where we already know the number of iterations of loop beforehand.
